# deng-homework  

This repo is to share my progress for the [data-engineering-zoomcamp](https://github.com/DataTalksClub/data-engineering-zoomcamp) taught by [alexeygrigorev](https://github.com/alexeygrigorev), [sejalv](https://github.com/sejalv), [Victoriapm](https://github.com/Victoriapm) and [AnkushKhanna](https://github.com/AnkushKhanna)  

Here you will find one folder for each week, and also other folders (such as one for notes).   

Within the week's folder you will find:

- A `week_*_hw.md` file with the corresponding questions and answers  
- Auxiliary files, such as Airflow DAGs, Docker files and SQL scripts  

I'm also documenting my progress on twitter [@canovasjm](https://twitter.com/canovasjm) using the hashtag `#dezoomcamp`
